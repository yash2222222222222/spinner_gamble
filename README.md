# SPINNER GAMBLE

###YES ALL OF THIS BELOW IS WRITTEN BY AI BUT THE ACTUAL CODE IS WRITTEN BY ME 
SO KINDLY APPRECIATE HAHAHA!!!

## 💻 Text-Based Slot Machine

This project is a simple, command-line slot machine game built with Python. 🎰 Users can deposit virtual money, bet on a number of lines, and spin the reels to win or lose. The game is designed to be a fun way to demonstrate core programming concepts in a practical application.

## ✨ Features

* **User-Friendly Interface**: The game uses a simple text-based interface for all user interactions. ⌨️
* **Dynamic Betting**: Players can choose to bet on 1, 2, or 3 lines.
* **Randomized Spins**: The game simulates a real slot machine using Python's `random` module to create a unique outcome on every spin. 🎲
* **Automatic Win Calculation**: The code automatically checks for winning combinations and calculates payouts based on the symbols' values and the user's bet. 💰
* **Robust Input Handling**: The program handles invalid inputs (like letters or negative numbers) without crashing. ✅

## 🚀 Skills Showcased

This project is a great example of a few key skills:

* **Functions & Modularity**: The code is organized into separate functions for each task (`deposit`, `get_bet`, etc.).
* **Control Flow**: The project uses `if`/`else` statements and `while` loops to manage the game's logic and user input.
* **Data Structures**: Dictionaries and lists are used to store and manipulate game data, like symbol probabilities and the slot machine grid.
